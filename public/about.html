<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Maurissa Price-Rollins, I am 27 and I live in Pittsburgh... for now. I attended Woodland Hills High School then
  Slippery Rock University. I majored in Policital Science and Marketing but I did not finish school. Since I did not finihsing school 
  I began a career in sales in 2020 and had great success but it is not something I can see myself doing until retirement. I have 
  always had a fancination with computers and websites and how they are made and work, so I researched, I attened bootcamp and here we are.
  With my facination, an ability to learn new skills quickly, and not being satisfied in my current field, I figured now is the time to 
  invest in myself to be able to earn money doing somehting I love. 
  This is the first live website I have ever made and I cannot wait to see how far I go!</p>

<p>I have always been an athlete, I started playing basketball at 10 and continued through high school. When I got to college
  I picked up Rugby and it became my all time favorite sport to play. Basketball is still my favorite to watch. I work fantastically 
  in a team setting but also have the descipline to excel alone.</p> 

<p>A little more about me... I have a little sister named Cheyenne, she is 16 and already a varsity cheerleader. My parents are TJ Rollins and 
  Amber Price whom I love to no end. My grandmother AKA G-MA!, she is my rock and more, and she goes by Carol Rollins. My spouse and hopefully 
  eventually wife is Raven, she is the light of my eyes and I hope we make it down the aisle.</p>
